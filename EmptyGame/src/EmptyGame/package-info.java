/**
 * This is a working game implementation that does nothing.
 *
 * All custom games should be built from this project, as it has all the basic
 * functionality already implemented. To implement your game, you should
 * complete the base classes' ({@link StrategySimulator.Library.GameLogic},
 * {@link StrategySimulator.Library.Player}, {@link StrategySimulator.Library.PlayerManager})
 * implementations, and write some actual players. Do not rename
 * the base classes! Player implementations' name should end with "Player".
 * @version 1.6.0
